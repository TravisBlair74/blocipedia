# Explanation
I created this application as part of my Bloc curriculum.  General guidelines were given but
specific instructions were not, making this a great learning experience for me.  Many new technologies weer
introduced to me as part of this project including Devise, Pundit, Faker and Stripe, and getting to know all
of them will be crucial to my ability to build what I want in an app in the future.
